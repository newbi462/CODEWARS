# Completed CodeWars Challenges or Kata as it were

I enjoy completing [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) challenges to keep my skills sharp. These are the solutions to my successfully completed katas.

Currently I am honing my JavaScript skills.

I will also use this Git to store some of my in-progress kata so I can work on them with the benefits Git offers, as another point of this Git is to white board my logic and help others learn. To that end my dead-end attempts and writing up a README.md is a form of self correction and pay it forward.
