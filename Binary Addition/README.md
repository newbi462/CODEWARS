# Problem: [Binary Addition](https://www.codewars.com/kata/551f37452ff852b7bd000139)

Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.

The binary number returned should be a string.

## Solution:
No explanation should be needed besides an understanding of the use of ```toString()```

But for those who do not know: ```toString()``` can also convert the base of a number.

In this case ```toString(2)``` would be base 2 binary 1 and 0, if it wanted hex that would be base 16 ```toString(16)``` and so on.
